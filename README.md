# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
This analysis is of the Amazon Vine program, a program that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.  Specifically, this project will aim to see if there is any bias for favorable reviews between Amazon Vine members and non-members.  Certain companies pay a fee to Amazon and provide products to Vine members who are required to write a review after receiving the product.  


## The Data
The dataset that was used is from the Amazon Review datasets page, and the category chosen was video games.
